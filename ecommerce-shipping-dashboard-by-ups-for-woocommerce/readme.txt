== External Services ==
Our plugin connects to `https://ups.dashboardlink.com` for advanced shipping label creation, using `api.itembase.com` as part of the UPS Dashboard for secure data transfer. This setup fetches order and product data from the WooCommerce API every few minutes to keep the workflow updated and accurate.

By using these tools, merchants get a high-performance solution for generating compliant shipping labels and improving logistics. Additionally, the services provided by Dashboard and Itembase are both covered by a Data Processing Agreement between UPS and the respective vendors, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
